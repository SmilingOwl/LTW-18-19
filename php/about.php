        <p> Eunoia is a word that ancient Greeks often use to describe well mind and beautiful thinking,  
        Aristotle uses the term to refer to the kind and benevolent feelings of goodwill when you tell a story. 
        </p>
        <p>
        This word inspired us to develop a website,
            in order to allow you to share your stories with people with similar tastes to yours!
            It's a website thoughtfully designed, beautifully crafted to be simple, clean and easy to use.
