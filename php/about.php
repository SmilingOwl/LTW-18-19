        <p> Eunoia is a word that ancient Greeks often use to describe beautiful thinking,  
        Aristotles used the term to refer to the kind and benevolent feelings of goodwill when you tell a story. 
        </p>
        <p>
        This word inspired us to develop a website,
            in order to allow you to share your stories with people with similar tastes to yours!
            It's a website thoughtfully designed, beautifully crafted to be simple, clean and easy to use.

            This project was developed for the Web Languages and Technologies (LTW) class of the Masters Degree in Informatics and Computer Engineering
            (MIEIC) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP), by Ana Secuiu, Helena Montenegro and Juliana Marques in 2018.
