    <h3>About</h3>
</header>
<div class="about">
    <p> Eunoia is a word that ancient Greeks often use to describe beautiful thinking,  
    Aristotles used the term to refer to the kind and benevolent feelings of goodwill when you tell a story. 
    </p>
    <p>
    This word inspired us to develop a website,
        in order to allow you to share your stories with people with similar tastes to yours!
        It's a website thoughtfully designed, beautifully crafted to be simple, clean and easy to use.
